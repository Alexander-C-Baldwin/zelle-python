 Python Programming: Introduction to Computer Science
This repository features my solutions to the well known *Python Programming: Introduction to Computer Science* book by John Zelle. 

As a self-learner of CS, I found this book to be a powerfully useful tool for learning the basics of Python. As an educator, I appreciate the attention to sequencing of foundational concepts in computer science. With hundreds of exercises, Zelle has students learn by writing scripts.

#### Disclaimer:
This repo is designed to be a referential repository for others traversing this book without the aid of an instructor to check their solutions against mine.  If you intend to learn to program using Python,  you need to do the work. Please use this repo responsibly.
